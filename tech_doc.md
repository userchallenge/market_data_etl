### Step 5: Trading-Day Aligned Data System Core Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Purpose**: Implemented a comprehensive trading-day aligned data system to synchronize sparse economic indicators with stock price data using standardized trading calendars as the master timeline. This addresses the fundamental challenge of aligning economic data (released irregularly) with trading data (daily on business days only) for consistent financial analysis.

**Changed Files**:
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/utils/trading_calendar.py` - NEW: Trading calendar system with multi-exchange support
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/data/models.py` - MODIFIED: Added AlignedDailyData model with composite key
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/data/forward_fill.py` - NEW: Forward-fill transformer for data alignment
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/database/manager.py` - MODIFIED: Added aligned data storage/retrieval methods
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/etl/load.py` - MODIFIED: Added AlignedDataETLOrchestrator for pipeline orchestration

**Technical Implementation Details**:

#### Trading Calendar System
- Installed pandas-market-calendars v5.1.1
- Created TradingCalendar class supporting multiple exchanges:
  - US Markets: NYSE, NASDAQ
  - European: Stockholm (STO), London (LSE), Frankfurt (FRA)
  - Automatic detection: AAPL→US, ESSITY-B.ST→STO, ^OMXS30→STO
- Methods: `get_trading_days()`, `is_trading_day()`, `detect_exchange_from_ticker()`

#### Database Architecture
```sql
CREATE TABLE aligned_daily_data (
    date DATE,
    instrument_id INTEGER,
    -- Price data
    open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, adjusted_close, volume,
    -- US Economic indicators
    inflation_monthly_us, unemployment_monthly_rate_us, interest_rate_monthly_us,
    -- European Economic indicators  
    inflation_monthly_euro, unemployment_rate_monthly_euro, interest_rate_change_day_euro,
    -- Metadata
    trading_calendar VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (date, instrument_id)
);
```

#### Forward-Fill Logic
- **Economic Indicators**: Forward-filled from release dates to trading days until next release
- **Example**: Jan CPI (released Feb 15) applies to all trading days Feb 15 → Mar 15
- **Rate Changes**: ECB rate 3.75% on Jul 27 → 4.00% on Sep 14, trading days Jul 27-Sep 13 carry 3.75%
- **Master Timeline**: Stock trading calendar drives alignment (no weekends/holidays)

#### ETL Pipeline
```
Sparse Economic Data → ForwardFillTransformer → Trading Calendar Alignment → AlignedDailyData Table
```

**Significant Findings**: 
- Pandas-market-calendars v5.1.1 provides robust multi-exchange support but requires careful configuration for international markets
- Composite primary key (date, instrument_id) design enables efficient single-table storage while maintaining data integrity
- Forward-fill approach during ETL processing is more performant than real-time alignment queries
- Automatic exchange detection from ticker symbols streamlines multi-market operations
- Complete recalculation strategy preferred over incremental updates for data consistency

**Architecture Achieved**:
- ✅ Single aligned table with all indicators as columns for easy analysis
- ✅ Pandas market calendars for standardized international trading days  
- ✅ Forward-fill during ETL with actual release dates (no lag functionality)
- ✅ Complete recalculation approach rather than incremental updates
- ✅ Trading calendar detection from ticker symbols automatically

**Learnings for Next Task**:
- CLI integration must follow unified file structure (add to existing cli/commands.py, not separate files)
- Testing should validate alignment accuracy across different market calendars and sparse economic data patterns  
- Documentation should emphasize the master timeline concept (trading days drive alignment, not calendar days)
- Performance monitoring needed for large-scale historical backfills across multiple tickers and indicators
- Consider memory optimization for bulk operations when scaling to hundreds of tickers

**Status**: Core architecture complete and ready for CLI integration, historical data backfill, and end-to-end validation testing.

**Next Steps**:
1. Add CLI commands (rebuild-aligned-data, query-aligned-data)
2. Backfill historical aligned data 
3. End-to-end testing
4. Update documentation

### Step 12: Trading-Day Aligned Data System Implementation Complete

### Step 15: Economic Indicator System Enhancement - Auto-Extension and Bulk Processing

**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Purpose**: Implement comprehensive economic indicator system improvements to enable automatic data forward-filling, bulk processing capabilities, and resolve ECB indicator mapping conflicts. The goal was to create a robust, automated system that maintains data continuity from API endpoints to current date while supporting efficient batch operations.

**Changed Files**:
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/cli/commands.py` - Added auto_extend_to_today tracking, bulk fetch command, fixed ECB series mapping
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/cli/main.py` - Added bulk command parser and dispatch logic  
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/database/manager.py` - Implemented _forward_fill_to_today() method with API data precedence
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/etl/load.py` - Updated ETL orchestrators to accept auto_extend_to_today parameter
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/etl/transform.py` - Fixed ECB indicator mapping conflicts using frequency-specific identifiers
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/data/fetchers.py` - Enhanced fetchers for improved economic data handling
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/market_data_etl/etl/extract.py` - Enhanced extractors for economic data processing

**Key Features Implemented**:

#### 1. Auto-Extension Forward-Fill Logic
- Economic indicators now automatically forward-fill from latest API date to today's date when no `--to` parameter is specified
- System distinguishes between user-specified and auto-extended date ranges
- Monthly forward-fill generation ensures data continuity through current date
- API data takes precedence over forward-filled records when new data becomes available

#### 2. Bulk Processing Command
```bash
# New bulk command processes all available economic indicators
market-data-etl fetch-all-economic-indicators --from 2024-01-01
market-data-etl fetch-all-economic-indicators --from 2020-01-01 --to 2024-12-31
```
- Continue-on-failure strategy maximizes successful data collection
- Comprehensive error handling and success/failure reporting
- Processes 7 available economic indicators across Eurostat, ECB, and FRED sources

#### 3. ECB Indicator Mapping Fixes
- Resolved duplicate series mapping that prevented proper indicator creation
- Fixed conflict between `interest_rate_change_day_euro` and `interest_rate_monthly_euro`
- Used frequency-specific identifiers: daily (FM.D.) vs monthly (FM.B.) series
- Both ECB interest rate indicators now create successfully

#### 4. Database Enhancement
```python
def _forward_fill_to_today(self, session, indicator_db_id, api_data_points):
    # Generate monthly fill dates through today
    # Create forward-filled records only for dates that don't exist
    # Ensure API data precedence over forward-filled records
```

**Testing Results**: 
- ✅ Successfully processed 7/7 economic indicators in bulk command  
- ✅ Forward-fill logic tested with various date ranges
- ✅ API data precedence verified through database record updates
- ✅ ECB indicator creation fixed and validated
- ✅ Auto-extension functionality working for all economic indicator commands

**Significant Findings**: 
- ECB duplicate series mapping was preventing proper indicator creation - resolved using frequency-specific identifiers (daily vs monthly)
- Forward-fill logic requires careful API data precedence handling to prevent overwriting real data with interpolated values
- Bulk processing with continue-on-failure strategy successfully processed 7/7 economic indicators
- Auto-extension logic works effectively when no --to parameter is specified, maintaining data continuity through current date

**Architecture Enhanced**:
- ✅ Auto-extension forward-fill maintains data continuity to today's date
- ✅ API data precedence ensures real data overwrites forward-filled records  
- ✅ Bulk command enables efficient processing of all economic indicators
- ✅ ECB indicator mapping conflicts resolved with frequency-specific identifiers
- ✅ Enhanced CLI commands follow unified file structure patterns

**Learnings for Next Task**: 
- Database operations must always prioritize API data over forward-filled records to maintain data integrity
- Bulk command patterns with comprehensive error reporting are essential for processing multiple indicators efficiently
- Series mapping conflicts require unique identifier strategies when dealing with multiple data frequencies from same source
- Auto-extension functionality should be parameter-driven to distinguish between user-specified and system-generated date ranges
- Continue-on-failure patterns are critical for bulk operations to maximize successful data collection

**Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅ - Enhanced economic indicator system with auto-extension, bulk processing, and ECB mapping fixes successfully implemented and tested.

### Before/After Architecture

**Before Phase 1B (Dual-Source System):**
```
Indicator Lookup: YAML Config → Hardcoded Fallback → Generic Fallback
- 8 indicators in YAML + 43 lines hardcoded duplicates
- Silent fallbacks masked configuration issues
- Two maintenance points for same data
```

**After Phase 1B (Pure YAML):**
```
Indicator Lookup: YAML Config → Clear Error with Available Options
- 8 indicators in YAML only
- Explicit errors with debugging guidance
- Single source of truth for all mappings
```

### Configuration Files Structure
```
config/
├── app_config.yaml              # Core application settings (database, logging, retry)
└── economic_indicators.yaml     # ALL indicator mappings (8 indicators: Eurostat, ECB, FRED)
```

### Benefits Achieved
- **Single Source of Truth**: All economic indicator mappings exist only in YAML configuration

# Added FK constraint enforcement
def __init__(self, db_path: str = None):
    # Enable foreign key constraints
    @event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
    def set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
        cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")

# Fixed table deletion order
def clear_all_data(self):
    # Delete child tables first (respect FK constraints)
    session.execute(text("DELETE FROM portfolio_holdings"))
    session.execute(text("DELETE FROM transactions")) 
    # Then parent tables
