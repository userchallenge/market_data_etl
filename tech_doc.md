### Step 5: Trading-Day Aligned Data System Core Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Purpose**: Implemented a comprehensive trading-day aligned data system to synchronize sparse economic indicators with stock price data using standardized trading calendars as the master timeline. This addresses the fundamental challenge of aligning economic data (released irregularly) with trading data (daily on business days only) for consistent financial analysis.

**Changed Files**:
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/utils/trading_calendar.py` - NEW: Trading calendar system with multi-exchange support
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/data/models.py` - MODIFIED: Added AlignedDailyData model with composite key
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/data/forward_fill.py` - NEW: Forward-fill transformer for data alignment
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/database/manager.py` - MODIFIED: Added aligned data storage/retrieval methods
- `/Users/cw/Python/market_data_etl/etl/load.py` - MODIFIED: Added AlignedDataETLOrchestrator for pipeline orchestration

**Technical Implementation Details**:

#### Trading Calendar System
- Installed pandas-market-calendars v5.1.1
- Created TradingCalendar class supporting multiple exchanges:
  - US Markets: NYSE, NASDAQ
  - European: Stockholm (STO), London (LSE), Frankfurt (FRA)
  - Automatic detection: AAPL→US, ESSITY-B.ST→STO, ^OMXS30→STO
- Methods: `get_trading_days()`, `is_trading_day()`, `detect_exchange_from_ticker()`

#### Database Architecture
```sql
CREATE TABLE aligned_daily_data (
    date DATE,
    instrument_id INTEGER,
    -- Price data
    open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, adjusted_close, volume,
    -- US Economic indicators
    inflation_monthly_us, unemployment_monthly_rate_us, interest_rate_monthly_us,
    -- European Economic indicators  
    inflation_monthly_euro, unemployment_rate_monthly_euro, interest_rate_change_day_euro,
    -- Metadata
    trading_calendar VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (date, instrument_id)
);
```

#### Forward-Fill Logic
- **Economic Indicators**: Forward-filled from release dates to trading days until next release
- **Example**: Jan CPI (released Feb 15) applies to all trading days Feb 15 → Mar 15
- **Rate Changes**: ECB rate 3.75% on Jul 27 → 4.00% on Sep 14, trading days Jul 27-Sep 13 carry 3.75%
- **Master Timeline**: Stock trading calendar drives alignment (no weekends/holidays)

#### ETL Pipeline
```
Sparse Economic Data → ForwardFillTransformer → Trading Calendar Alignment → AlignedDailyData Table
```

**Significant Findings**: 
- Pandas-market-calendars v5.1.1 provides robust multi-exchange support but requires careful configuration for international markets
- Composite primary key (date, instrument_id) design enables efficient single-table storage while maintaining data integrity
- Forward-fill approach during ETL processing is more performant than real-time alignment queries
- Automatic exchange detection from ticker symbols streamlines multi-market operations
- Complete recalculation strategy preferred over incremental updates for data consistency

**Architecture Achieved**:
- ✅ Single aligned table with all indicators as columns for easy analysis
- ✅ Pandas market calendars for standardized international trading days  
- ✅ Forward-fill during ETL with actual release dates (no lag functionality)
- ✅ Complete recalculation approach rather than incremental updates
- ✅ Trading calendar detection from ticker symbols automatically

**Learnings for Next Task**:
- CLI integration must follow unified file structure (add to existing cli/commands.py, not separate files)
- Testing should validate alignment accuracy across different market calendars and sparse economic data patterns  
- Documentation should emphasize the master timeline concept (trading days drive alignment, not calendar days)
- Performance monitoring needed for large-scale historical backfills across multiple tickers and indicators
- Consider memory optimization for bulk operations when scaling to hundreds of tickers

**Status**: Core architecture complete and ready for CLI integration, historical data backfill, and end-to-end validation testing.

**Next Steps**:
1. Add CLI commands (rebuild-aligned-data, query-aligned-data)
2. Backfill historical aligned data 
3. End-to-end testing
4. Update documentation
